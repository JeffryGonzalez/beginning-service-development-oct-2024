# The Software Center

We are building an app for our companie's in-house software entitlement team. 

They want an API (and an app, for another class) that allows them to add software to the catalog of supported software at this "company".

We will do that part in later classes.


## The Help Desk

We want a way for employees to submit challenges they have with supported software at our company.

They can provide a description of the issue they are having, and add other information which will help the help desk staff "triage" the concern.

Is it an inconveniennce?
Is it stopping them from doing their work?
Is it causing problems with the company beinng able to fulfill it's mission?

### Status

We also want to have a way for employees to check the "status" of the help desk as a whole.

What is the backlog for getting help with an issue?

Who can I contact if it is an emergency?
